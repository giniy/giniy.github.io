"Fading Echoes"

[Verse 1]
The moonlight fades, the night stands still,
Shadows whisper, yet I'm lost in the chill.
Every breath feels like a ghost of the past,
Time moves forward, but I'm stuck in the last.

[Pre-Chorus]
Footsteps echo in an empty hall,
Calling your name, but there’s no one at all.
The weight of silence, heavy like stone,
I reach for your hand, but I’m left alone.

[Chorus]
And I’m falling… deeper into the night,
Drowning in the echoes of a love lost in time.
If I scream, would you hear me at all?
Or am I just another name on your wall?

[Verse 2]
The photographs, they stare with hollow eyes,
Faded smiles wrapped in beautiful lies.
The wind still sings the songs we knew,
But now every melody is painted blue.

[Pre-Chorus]
Footsteps echo in an empty hall,
Calling your name, but there’s no one at all.
The weight of silence, heavy like stone,
I reach for your hand, but I’m left alone.

[Chorus]
And I’m falling… deeper into the night,
Drowning in the echoes of a love lost in time.
If I scream, would you hear me at all?
Or am I just another name on your wall?

[Bridge]
The sky is burning, but I feel so cold,
Words left unspoken, stories untold.
If I close my eyes, will you be near?
Or will I wake to the sound of my own tears?

[Outro]
The stars may shine, but they don’t light my way,
The world moves on, but I still fade away.
So I’ll leave my heart where the lost souls go,
Just another echo in the wind’s soft woe…
